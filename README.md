# Frame-less LaserHarp
It is an electronic musical interface which resembles the ancient musical string instrument "Harp".
# Key features
* Frameless design ("Infinite beam")
* Has several laser beams,each designating a musical note, played by blocking 
  the rays of the beam
* A single beam is split to several ones in a fan fashion using one laser source
  and a mirror mounted on a stepper motor
* Relies on detection of note to be played from beam obstructed with the help of a photodiode
* Depending on the position of stepper motor at the time of obstruction,the musical note is played
* Playing the actual sound is handled by connecting the laser harp to a synthesiser,
  in our case a freeware FL studio
